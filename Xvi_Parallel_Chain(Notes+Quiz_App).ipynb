            "1. When you view your face in the curved surface of a spoon, you will observe that the curved surface acts as a spherical mirror. If the spoon is curved inwards, it will act as a concave mirror, and if it is curved outwards, it will act as a convex mirror. In both cases, you will see a virtual image of your face, which appears to be upright and of the same size as the object. The image will be laterally inverted, meaning that it will appear to be on the opposite side of the mirror as your actual face.\n",

            "2. The image formed by a concave mirror is real, inverted, and larger than the object. On the other hand, the image formed by a convex mirror is virtual, erect, and smaller than the object. This is because the concave mirror converges light rays, resulting in a real and inverted image, while the convex mirror diverges light rays, resulting in a virtual and erect image.\n"
